The Jinaga Replicator is a single machine in a network.
It stores and shares facts.
To get started, create a Replicator of your very own using [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/).

```
docker pull jinaga/jinaga-replicator
docker run --name my-replicator -p8080:8080 jinaga/jinaga-replicator
```

This creates and starts a new container called `my-replicator`.
The container is listening at port 8080 for commands.
Use a tool like [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) to `POST` messages to `http://localhost:8080/jinaga/write` and `/read`.
Or configure a Jinaga client to connect to the Replicator.

```typescript
import { JinagaBrowser } from "jinaga";

export const j = JinagaBrowser.create({
    httpEndpoint: "http://localhost:8080/jinaga"
});
```
